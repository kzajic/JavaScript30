    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
   

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
     const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
     const team4 = [...players];

     const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const capitan = person;
    capitan.number = 99;
    console.log(person);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 =Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});

    //and the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    cap3.number = 30;
    console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      social: {
        twitter: '@bla',
        facebook: '@blabla'
      }
    };

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    //social is still reference to original

    //you need a function to clone deep or this, but not recomended

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    dev2.social.facebook = '@blablabla'
    console.log(dev2)
    console.log(wes)
